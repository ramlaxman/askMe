Write a function that will return each item in a given list.
If the list includes additional lists, it will also return their items
as well as a single item and not a list.

Guidelines
----------
Use generators in your solution

Example
--------
[1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6] -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6
[1, [2, 3, [4, 5, 6] ], 7] -> 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
