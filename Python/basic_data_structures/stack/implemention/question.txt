Implement stack

User should be able:

1. Push item to the stack
2. Pop item from the stack
3. Check if stack is empty
4. Check stack's size

Hints/Guidance
--------------
1. List in Python can be used as stack, but this is not what you should do.
   You should implement your own stack class (The class can use list).

2. Allow user to print stack as real stack, so it can be seen which item is
   at the top and which is at the bottom.
