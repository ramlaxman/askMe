Write a function which converts infix notation to postfix.

Infix is when the operator is in between two operands.
Postfix is when all the operators are placed after the operands.

Infix examples:

X * Y + Z
W * X * Y * Z
(X + Y) * (W + Z)

Postfix examples:

X Y * Z +
W X Y Z *
X Y + W Z + *

You have stack.py included in this directory, which defines Stack object.
You can use it in your program.
