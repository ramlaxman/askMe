Write a program which simulates the "Hot Potato" game. The input is a list 
of names and an number.

In "Hot Potato" game, there is a circle of people and each person is passing 
an hot potato as fast as they can to the person next to them.
At some point, the passing stopped (in our case the stopping determined by the
num passed to the program) and the person holding the potato is removed from
the circle.

Hints/Guidance
--------------
1. You have queue.py included in this directory, which defines a Queue object.
You can use it in your program.

2. To simulate the circle, use queue.

3. The person in front of the queue is the person holding the potato.
