Implement a queue

User should be able:

1. Insert item into the queue (aka enqueue)
2. Pop item from the queue (aka dequeue)
3. Check if queue is empty
4. Check queue's size

Hints/Guidance
--------------
1. List in Python can be used as queue, but this is not what you should do.
   You should implement your own queue class (The class can use list).
