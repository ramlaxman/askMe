Implement producer and consumer while using a queue

Producer is responsible for inserting tasks into the queue.
Consumer is responsible for reading tasks from the queue.

Hints/Guidance
--------------
1. You can use Python built-in 'Queue' module
2. To run Producer and Consumer use the 'threading' module
3. You can isert to the queue any type of object you want. I recommend on datetime.datetime.now().
4. Make sure to sleep after reading/putting each item to and from the queue.
