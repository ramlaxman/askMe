The printer simulation software should compose of:

1. Print tasks, submitted by another software or a user.
2. Print qeueu, to process print tasks.
3. Printer, to print and manage the print queue.

Hints/Guidance
--------------
* You should create three classes: Printer, PrintTask, PrintQueue:
    Printer -   represenets the printer Should be given a ppg parameter (pages per minute).
    PrintTask - represenets a print task. Should be given a number of pages.
    PrintQueue - represents a printer queue where tasks should be submitted or pulled from.

* Use threading library to run the printer as a thread

* Submit several different tasks after running the printer to verify it works properly.
