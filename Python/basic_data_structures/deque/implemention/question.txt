Implement a deque

User should be able:

1. Create a deque instance.
1. Insert item into the deque, to the front or the rear of the deque.
2. Pop item from the deque, from the front or the rear of the deque.
3. Check if the deque is empty.
4. Check deque's size

Hints/Guidance
--------------
1. List in Python can be used as deque, but this is not what you should do.
   You should implement your own deque class (The class can use list) so users
   can create an instance of it.
