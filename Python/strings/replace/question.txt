Write a funciton which implements Python's string replace method

Replace used to replace all the occurrences of a specific string
with another given string.

Hints
-----
* Signature should look like "replace(base_string, to_replace, replace_with)"
  unless you prefer to have String class with this method.
* Use slices :)
